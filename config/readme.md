# Configuration

- **config.ini**: The configuration file config.ini holds paramaters which are loaded through the configuration api under lib/config.
- **rgb|depth{camera_id}.yaml**: camera calibration parameters which are loaded, when executing the launch files under /driver. Keep in mind that you have to include the same intrinsics in config.ini
